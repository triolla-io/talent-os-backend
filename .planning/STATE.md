# State: Triolla Talent OS — Backend

**Initialized:** 2026-03-22 at 00:00 UTC
**Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5
**Budget:** 200,000 tokens

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Inbound CVs are automatically processed, de-duplicated, and scored against open jobs without any manual recruiter effort — end-to-end from email receipt to scored candidate record.

**Current Focus:** Phase 06 — duplicate-detection

**Tech Stack (Locked):** TypeScript, NestJS 11, BullMQ + Redis, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL 16, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Haiku + Sonnet, Cloudflare R2, Postmark Inbound webhooks.

## Current Position

Phase: 06 (duplicate-detection) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Locked (Phase 1 scope)

1. **Database Schema First**: All 7 tables with tenant_id, indexes, constraints created in Prisma migration before webhook endpoint
2. **Separate API + Worker**: NestJS HTTP only, separate BullMQ worker process — never block webhook receipt
3. **Environment Validation at Startup**: @nestjs/config + Zod — fail fast on missing vars, don't deploy broken config
4. **No In-Memory Dedup**: pg_trgm extension, not vector DB or Elasticsearch — scales naturally, zero infra
5. **Append-Only Scores**: candidate_job_scores never updated, always appended — full history preserved
6. **Fuzzy Match → Human Review**: Never auto-upsert on fuzzy match — dual-name confusion is data corruption, flag for human

### Research Completed

- Full architecture spec approved 2026-03-19: `spec/backend-architecture-proposal.md`
- Postmark inbound webhook auth method confirmed
- pg_trgm performance validated at 500 CVs/month scale
- Cost model: ~€5/month Hetzner + ~$6–16/month Anthropic

### Open Questions (Phase 2+)

- Recruiter auth solution (JWT vs Clerk vs other)
- Outbound email provider for candidate outreach
- Voice screening approach (Twilio vs Elevenlabs vs other)
- Monitoring tooling (Sentry + BullMQ dashboard recommended but not blocking)

### Blockers

None — ready to proceed to `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-03-23T07:11:00.582Z
Last activity: 2026-03-23

**What Happened:**

1. Phase 01 (Foundation) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 01-01: NestJS bootstrap + BullMQ worker entry point
   - 01-02: Prisma schema (7 tables), migration, pg_trgm indexes, seed data
   - 01-03: Multi-stage Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml (4 services, health checks) — human checkpoint passed
2. Quick tasks: Prisma 6→7 upgrade (260322-kkx), env/docker-compose fix (260322-lsq)
3. Phase 02 (Webhook Intake & Idempotency) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 02-01: PostmarkPayloadDto (Zod), test scaffolds, IngestionProcessor stub
   - 02-02: PostmarkAuthGuard (Basic Auth), WebhooksService (idempotency + enqueue), WebhooksController
   - 02-03: Wire WebhooksModule + IngestionModule into root modules; human smoke test passed (all 8 checks)
   - Auto-fix applied: Dockerfile CMD path + UUID validation corrected during Docker startup verification
4. Phase 03 (Processing Pipeline & Spam Filter) — all 4 plans complete ✓
   - 03-00: 3 test spec stub files created (spam-filter, attachment-extractor, processor integration)
   - 03-01: SpamFilterService with 5 passing unit tests (PROC-02, PROC-03)
   - 03-02: AttachmentExtractorService (pdf-parse + mammoth) with 5 passing unit tests (PROC-04, PROC-05)
   - 03-03: Fixed Phase 2 blob-stripping bug; wired full IngestionProcessor pipeline; 2 integration tests (PROC-06)
   - 22 total tests passing across 3 suites after Phase 03
5. Phase 04 (AI Extraction) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 04-00: extraction-agent.service.spec.ts stub + minimal service stub created
   - 04-01: ExtractionAgentService (deterministic mock) with CandidateExtractSchema (Zod) + 5 unit tests (AIEX-01, AIEX-02, AIEX-03)
   - 04-02: ExtractionAgentService wired into IngestionProcessor + IngestionModule; 2 integration tests; 34 total tests passing
   - Note: ExtractionAgentService.extract() is a deterministic mock returning hardcoded 'Jane Doe' — real Anthropic Haiku call pending Phase 5 or follow-up
5. Phase 05 (File Storage) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 05-00: StorageService stub, StorageModule, and failing test scaffolds created (Nyquist setup)
   - 05-01: StorageService (S3Client, PutObjectCommand, attachment selection, R2 key generation) with 5 unit tests (STOR-01, STOR-02, D-07, D-11)
   - 05-02: StorageService wired into IngestionProcessor via constructor injection; ProcessingContext extended with fileKey (string|null) and cvText fields; IngestionModule imports StorageModule; 3 integration tests (5-02-01, 5-02-02, 5-02-03) — 70 total tests passing across 11 suites
   - Verification: 6/6 must-haves verified — PASSED
   - Note: ExtractionAgentService.extract() remains a deterministic mock (TODO in Phase 4 code) — real Anthropic Haiku call still pending; does not block Phase 6

6. Quick task 260322-uov — 3 critical bugs fixed in ingestion pipeline ✓
   - BUG-CV-LOSS: storageService.upload() moved before extractionAgent.extract() — CV now persisted even on AI failure
   - BUG-RETRY: Changed `return` to `throw err` in extraction catch — BullMQ now retries on transient failures
   - BUG-RACE: Added jobId: messageId to both queue.add() calls + P2002 try/catch in prisma.create — concurrent duplicates handled gracefully
   - 75 tests passing (5 new tests added), 11 suites, 0 failures

**Next Step:**
Phase 06 — Duplicate Detection. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 6` (or `/gsd:discuss-phase 6` first).
