# State: Triolla Talent OS — Backend (Phase 1)

**Initialized:** 2026-03-22 at 00:00 UTC
**Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5
**Budget:** 200,000 tokens

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Inbound CVs are automatically processed, de-duplicated, and scored against open jobs without any manual recruiter effort — end-to-end from email receipt to scored candidate record.

**Current Focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

**Tech Stack (Locked):** TypeScript, NestJS 11, BullMQ + Redis, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL 16, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Haiku + Sonnet, Cloudflare R2, Postmark Inbound webhooks.

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — COMPLETE ✓
Phase: 02 (webhook) — NEXT

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Locked (Phase 1 scope)

1. **Database Schema First**: All 7 tables with tenant_id, indexes, constraints created in Prisma migration before webhook endpoint
2. **Separate API + Worker**: NestJS HTTP only, separate BullMQ worker process — never block webhook receipt
3. **Environment Validation at Startup**: @nestjs/config + Zod — fail fast on missing vars, don't deploy broken config
4. **No In-Memory Dedup**: pg_trgm extension, not vector DB or Elasticsearch — scales naturally, zero infra
5. **Append-Only Scores**: candidate_job_scores never updated, always appended — full history preserved
6. **Fuzzy Match → Human Review**: Never auto-upsert on fuzzy match — dual-name confusion is data corruption, flag for human

### Research Completed

- Full architecture spec approved 2026-03-19: `spec/backend-architecture-proposal.md`
- Postmark inbound webhook auth method confirmed
- pg_trgm performance validated at 500 CVs/month scale
- Cost model: ~€5/month Hetzner + ~$6–16/month Anthropic

### Open Questions (Phase 2+)

- Recruiter auth solution (JWT vs Clerk vs other)
- Outbound email provider for candidate outreach
- Voice screening approach (Twilio vs Elevenlabs vs other)
- Monitoring tooling (Sentry + BullMQ dashboard recommended but not blocking)

### Blockers

None — ready to proceed to `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.

### Quick Tasks Completed

### Todos

- [ ] Deploy to Hetzner VPS (post-Phase 7)

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-03-22T15:43:10Z
Last activity: 2026-03-22 - Completed quick task 260322-lsq: Fix env and docker-compose inconsistency

**What Happened:**

1. Phase 01 (Foundation) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 01-01: NestJS bootstrap + BullMQ worker entry point
   - 01-02: Prisma schema (7 tables), migration, pg_trgm indexes, seed data
   - 01-03: Multi-stage Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml (4 services, health checks) — human checkpoint passed
2. Docker Compose verified: all 4 services (api, worker, postgres, redis) started healthy
3. Quick task 260322-kkx: Upgraded Prisma 6 → 7.5.0 with @prisma/adapter-pg; created prisma.config.ts; tsc clean; all unit tests pass

**Next Step:**
Phase 02 — Postmark Webhook intake. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 2` (or `/gsd:discuss-phase 2` first for context gathering).
