# State: Triolla Talent OS — Backend

**Initialized:** 2026-03-22 at 00:00 UTC
**Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5
**Budget:** 200,000 tokens

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Inbound CVs are automatically processed, de-duplicated, and scored against open jobs without any manual recruiter effort — end-to-end from email receipt to scored candidate record.

**Current Focus:** Phase 13 — implement-kanban-board-with-candidate-hiring-stage-tracking

**Tech Stack (Locked):** TypeScript, NestJS 11, BullMQ + Redis, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL 16, Vercel AI SDK, Claude Haiku + Sonnet, Cloudflare R2, Postmark Inbound webhooks.

## Current Position

Phase: 13 (implement-kanban-board-with-candidate-hiring-stage-tracking) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1

**STATUS: Phase 13 (Kanban board) added to roadmap. Ready for planning.**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Locked (Phase 1 scope)

1. **Database Schema First**: All 7 tables with tenant_id, indexes, constraints created in Prisma migration before webhook endpoint
2. **Separate API + Worker**: NestJS HTTP only, separate BullMQ worker process — never block webhook receipt
3. **Environment Validation at Startup**: @nestjs/config + Zod — fail fast on missing vars, don't deploy broken config
4. **No In-Memory Dedup**: pg_trgm extension, not vector DB or Elasticsearch — scales naturally, zero infra
5. **Append-Only Scores**: candidate_job_scores never updated, always appended — full history preserved
6. **Fuzzy Match → Human Review**: Never auto-upsert on fuzzy match — dual-name confusion is data corruption, flag for human

### Research Completed

- Full architecture spec approved 2026-03-19: `spec/backend-architecture-proposal.md`
- Postmark inbound webhook auth method confirmed
- pg_trgm performance validated at 500 CVs/month scale
- Cost model: ~€5/month Hetzner + ~$6–16/month Anthropic

### Open Questions (Phase 2+)

- Recruiter auth solution (JWT vs Clerk vs other)
- Outbound email provider for candidate outreach
- Voice screening approach (Twilio vs Elevenlabs vs other)
- Monitoring tooling (Sentry + BullMQ dashboard recommended but not blocking)

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 9 added: Create client-facing REST API endpoints
- Phase 10 added: Add job creation feature
- Phase 11 added: Review and validate API protocol MVP spec and implementation guide
- Phase 12 discovered: Support add candidate from the UI (already planned)
- Phase 13 added: Implement Kanban board with candidate hiring stage tracking
- Phase 14 added: Wire OpenRouter extraction pipeline: email→LLM→dedup→scoring→UI

### Blockers

None — ready to proceed to `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-03-29T06:59:34.043Z
Last activity: 2026-03-29

**What Happened (Phase 11 Final):**

11. Phase 11 (API Protocol MVP Implementation) — COMPLETE ✓
    - 11-01: Full jobs API with GET /config, GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /jobs endpoints
    - Schema extended: JobStage (interviewer, is_enabled, color), ScreeningQuestion (expected_answer)
    - AppConfigModule with hardcoded 6 lookup tables and 4-stage template
    - JobsService: findAll() with nested data, createJob() with default stage seeding, updateJob() atomic delete-recreate, deleteJob() soft-delete
    - JobsController: all 5 endpoints with standard error format, validation, tenant isolation
    - CreateJobDto: snake_case fields, cross-field validation (at least one stage enabled)
    - 195 tests passing across 19 test suites (39 new integration tests)
    - Verification: human checkpoint approved for API response format and behavior
    - 1 deviation auto-fixed: color field added to schema (spec-required, not client-computed)

**Full Phase Completion:**

1. Phase 01 (Foundation) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 01-01: NestJS bootstrap + BullMQ worker entry point
   - 01-02: Prisma schema (7 tables), migration, pg_trgm indexes, seed data
   - 01-03: Multi-stage Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml (4 services, health checks) — human checkpoint passed
2. Quick tasks: Prisma 6→7 upgrade (260322-kkx), env/docker-compose fix (260322-lsq)
3. Phase 02 (Webhook Intake & Idempotency) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 02-01: PostmarkPayloadDto (Zod), test scaffolds, IngestionProcessor stub
   - 02-02: PostmarkAuthGuard (Basic Auth), WebhooksService (idempotency + enqueue), WebhooksController
   - 02-03: Wire WebhooksModule + IngestionModule into root modules; human smoke test passed (all 8 checks)
   - Auto-fix applied: Dockerfile CMD path + UUID validation corrected during Docker startup verification
4. Phase 03 (Processing Pipeline & Spam Filter) — all 4 plans complete ✓
   - 03-00: 3 test spec stub files created (spam-filter, attachment-extractor, processor integration)
   - 03-01: SpamFilterService with 5 passing unit tests (PROC-02, PROC-03)
   - 03-02: AttachmentExtractorService (pdf-parse + mammoth) with 5 passing unit tests (PROC-04, PROC-05)
   - 03-03: Fixed Phase 2 blob-stripping bug; wired full IngestionProcessor pipeline; 2 integration tests (PROC-06)
   - 22 total tests passing across 3 suites after Phase 03
5. Phase 04 (AI Extraction) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 04-00: extraction-agent.service.spec.ts stub + minimal service stub created
   - 04-01: ExtractionAgentService (deterministic mock) with CandidateExtractSchema (Zod) + 5 unit tests (AIEX-01, AIEX-02, AIEX-03)
   - 04-02: ExtractionAgentService wired into IngestionProcessor + IngestionModule; 2 integration tests; 34 total tests passing
   - Note: ExtractionAgentService.extract() is a deterministic mock returning hardcoded 'Jane Doe' — real Anthropic Haiku call pending Phase 5 or follow-up
5. Phase 05 (File Storage) — all 3 plans complete ✓
   - 05-00: StorageService stub, StorageModule, and failing test scaffolds created (Nyquist setup)
   - 05-01: StorageService (S3Client, PutObjectCommand, attachment selection, R2 key generation) with 5 unit tests (STOR-01, STOR-02, D-07, D-11)
   - 05-02: StorageService wired into IngestionProcessor via constructor injection; ProcessingContext extended with fileKey (string|null) and cvText fields; IngestionModule imports StorageModule; 3 integration tests (5-02-01, 5-02-02, 5-02-03) — 70 total tests passing across 11 suites
   - Verification: 6/6 must-haves verified — PASSED
   - Note: ExtractionAgentService.extract() remains a deterministic mock (TODO in Phase 4 code) — real Anthropic Haiku call still pending; does not block Phase 6

6. Quick task 260322-uov — 3 critical bugs fixed in ingestion pipeline ✓
   - BUG-CV-LOSS: storageService.upload() moved before extractionAgent.extract() — CV now persisted even on AI failure
   - BUG-RETRY: Changed `return` to `throw err` in extraction catch — BullMQ now retries on transient failures
   - BUG-RACE: Added jobId: messageId to both queue.add() calls + P2002 try/catch in prisma.create — concurrent duplicates handled gracefully
   - 75 tests passing (5 new tests added), 11 suites, 0 failures

7. Quick task 260323-d4s — Phase 6 bug fixes (pg_trgm + atomicity) ✓
   - Fixed pg_trgm % operator replaced with similarity() > 0.7 in SQL WHERE — threshold now enforced in SQL not app layer
   - Added GREATEST(similarity(name), similarity(reversedName)) — inverted tokens (Smith John vs John Smith) now match
   - Wrapped Phase 6 DB block in prisma.$transaction — candidate INSERT + flag + intake log update are atomic
   - Added tx? param to DedupService.insertCandidate, upsertCandidate, createFlag — defaults to this.prisma
   - 86 tests passing (3 new: DEDUP-06, DEDUP-07, atomicity test), 12 suites, 0 failures

8. Phases 07-11 (Parallel Implementation Waves)
   - Phase 07 (Candidate Scoring): scoring_agent.service.ts, ScoringModule, 48 tests
   - Phase 08 (Email Intake Log): intake_logs table, EnqueueHandler logging, 102 total tests
   - Phase 09 (REST API): JobsController, GET /jobs, POST /jobs, validation, 145 total tests
   - Phase 10 (Job Creation): POST /jobs enhancement, default stage seeding, 145 tests
   - Phase 11 (API Protocol MVP): Full job management API, schema updates, 195 tests

**Next Step:**
All Phase 1 MVP work complete. Ready for:

- Deployment to Hetzner VPS
- Phase 2 planning (recruiter auth, admin UI, outbound communications)
