# Talent OS - API Protocol (MVP)

This document is the single source of truth for all API endpoints supported by the Talent OS backend.

## General Configuration

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api` (or as configured via `VITE_API_URL`)
- **Required Headers** (for all endpoints except webhooks):
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `x-tenant-id`: `phase1-default-tenant` (Targeting multi-tenancy foundation)

---

## 1. Candidates API

### `GET /candidates/counts`

Retrieve lightweight counts for dashboard alerts.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "total": 42,
  "duplicates": 3,
  "unassigned": 7
}
```

**Notes:**

- `total` — count of active (non-rejected, non-deleted) candidates
- `duplicates` — count of active candidates with at least one unreviewed duplicate flag. Includes candidates flagged as `phone_missing` (see `is_duplicate` note below)
- `unassigned` — count of active candidates not yet linked to any job

---

### `GET /candidates`

Fetch candidates with optional search and filtering.

**Query Parameters:**

- `q` (optional): Search query matching name, role, or email (case-insensitive substring match)
- `filter` (optional): Filter type
  - `all` — all candidates (default)
  - `duplicates` — candidates with unreviewed duplicate flags
- `job_id` (optional): Filter candidates by job UUID (used for Kanban view)
- `unassigned` (optional): `'true'` — filters candidates not yet assigned to any job

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "full_name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1 555-0100",
      "current_role": "Software Engineer",
      "location": "Tel Aviv",
      "cv_file_url": "https://...",
      "source": "linkedin",
      "source_agency": null,
      "created_at": "ISO8601",
      "ai_score": 85,
      "cv_readable": true,
      "is_score_overridden": false,
      "is_duplicate": false,
      "skills": ["React", "TypeScript"],
      "status": "active",
      "is_rejected": false,
      "stage_summaries": { "uuid": "Summary text for this stage" },
      "job_id": "uuid",
      "hiring_stage_id": "uuid",
      "hiring_stage_name": "Screening",
      "job_title": "Senior Frontend Developer",
      "ai_summary": "Experienced engineer with strong React skills. Recommended for senior roles.",
      "years_experience": 5,
      "salary_expectation_min": 10000,
      "salary_expectation_max": 15000
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

**Notes on `is_duplicate`:**

`is_duplicate: true` means the candidate has at least one unreviewed `duplicate_flag`. There are two distinct cases:

- **Phone match** (`fields: ["phone"]`): Another candidate with the same phone number already exists. Both submissions are stored as separate rows — the existing candidate is not updated. The flag links the new row to the existing one. HR should review and merge manually.
- **Phone missing** (`fields: ["phone_missing"]`): No phone number could be extracted from the CV. This is a data quality flag, not a real duplicate signal. The candidate is flagged for HR review but is not linked to another person.

Do not treat `is_duplicate: true` as a guarantee that two candidate rows represent the same person — always check the flag type.

**Notes on `full_name`:**

For email-ingested CVs, if a candidate name cannot be detected, `full_name` will be `"Unknown Candidate"` (never an empty string).

**Notes on `cv_readable` and `is_score_overridden`:**

- `cv_readable` — derived boolean: `true` when the candidate has non-empty extracted CV text, else `false`. The raw `cv_text` is never returned by the API.
- `is_score_overridden` — `true` when a recruiter has manually set `ai_score`. Auto-scoring (intake + reassignment) will not overwrite the denormalized score while this is `true`.

### `GET /candidates/:id`

Fetch a single candidate by ID.

**Path Parameters:**

- `id`: Candidate UUID

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "full_name": "User Cohen",
  "email": "test@email.com",
  "phone": "+972-52-000-0000",
  "current_role": "Software Developer",

  "source": "direct",
  "source_agency": null,
  "created_at": "2026-03-29T14:24:39.233Z",
  "ai_score": null,
  "cv_readable": true,
  "is_score_overridden": false,
  "is_duplicate": false,
  "skills": [
    "c#",
    "javascript",
    "typescript",
    "node.js",
    "python",
    "java",
    "c++",
    "mongodb",

  "hiring_stage_id": "uuid",
  "hiring_stage_name": "Screening",
  "job_title": "Senior Frontend Developer",
  "ai_summary": "Experienced engineer with strong React skills. Recommended for senior roles.",
  "years_experience": 5,
  "salary_expectation_min": 10000,
  "salary_expectation_max": 15000
}
```

**Errors:**

- `404 Not Found` — candidate not found or does not belong to tenant

### `POST /candidates`

Create a new candidate profile, optionally with a CV file upload.

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

**Form Fields:**

- `cv_file` (optional): CV file (binary upload)
- All other candidate fields as form data (mirroring the body fields below)

**Request Body (JSON fields as form parts):**

```json
{
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+1 555-0100",
  "current_role": "Software Engineer",
  "location": "Tel Aviv",
  "years_experience": 5,
  "salary_expectation_min": 10000,
  "salary_expectation_max": 15000,
  "skills": ["React", "TypeScript"],
  "ai_summary": null,
  "cv_file_url": null,
  "source": "linkedin",
  "source_agency": null,
  "job_id": "uuid"
}
```

**Notes:**

- `full_name` and `source` are required
- `email`, `phone`, `current_role`, `location`, `years_experience`, `ai_summary`, `source_agency` are nullable
- `ai_summary` is newline-separated bullet lines — one short fact per line, no leading bullet glyph. May be empty/null when no summary exists. Legacy candidates may still hold a single paragraph; clients must render both forms (no migration).
- `job_id` is required — links the candidate to a specific job opening
- `source` must be one of: `linkedin`, `website`, `agency`, `referral`, `direct`, `manual`
- `source_agency` is only relevant when `source = agency`
- `cv_file` upload is binary; the server saves it and manages the `cv_file_url`
- `skills` can be passed as an array, a comma-separated string, or a JSON string

**Response:** `201 Created` (returns full candidate object, same structure as GET /candidates item)

**Errors:**

- `400 Bad Request` — validation failed
- `500 Internal Server Error` — server error

### `GET /candidates/:id/cv-url`

Fetch a presigned S3 URL for a candidate's CV (valid for 1 hour).

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

### `GET /candidates/:id/cv-file`

Stream the candidate's CV file bytes **same-origin** (proxied from R2). The client uses this to
render Word (`.docx`) CVs in-browser (docx-preview) and PDF/DOCX thumbnails without a cross-origin
(CORS) fetch of the R2 object. Tenant-scoped; requires an authenticated session.

**Response:** `200 OK` — raw file bytes

- `Content-Type`: the stored file's MIME type (e.g. `application/pdf`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`)
- `Content-Disposition`: `inline; filename="<candidate>.<ext>"`

**Errors:**

- `404 Not Found` — candidate not found (`NOT_FOUND`) or no CV on file (`NO_CV`)

### `PATCH /candidates/:id`

Update candidate profile fields and/or assign to a job pipeline.

**Request Body:** All fields optional

```json
{
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "full_name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "phone": "+1 555-0101",
  "current_role": "Product Manager",
  "location": "San Francisco",
  "years_experience": 7,
  "salary_expectation_min": 10000,
  "salary_expectation_max": 15000,
  "ai_score": 82
}
```

**Behavior:**

- If `job_id` is provided and candidate has no job: atomically creates Application and sets `hiringStageId` to first enabled stage.
- If `job_id` matches existing assignment: no-op for that field.
- If `job_id` differs from existing assignment: throws 400 ALREADY_ASSIGNED.
- If `ai_score` is provided (integer `0–100`): sets the denormalized score and marks `is_score_overridden = true`. Out-of-range or non-integer values return `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`. The override is sticky until reverted.
- All other fields are optional and updated independently.

**Response:** `200 OK` (returns full CandidateResponse)

**Errors:**

- `400 Bad Request` — validation failed or ALREADY_ASSIGNED
- `400 No Stages` — job has no enabled hiring stages
- `404 Not Found` — candidate not found

### `POST /candidates/:id/cv`

Upload a replacement CV. Re-extracts text, regenerates the AI summary, and re-scores the assigned job.

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

**Form Fields:**

- `cv_file` (required): CV file (binary upload). PDF / DOC / DOCX, ≤ 10 MB.

**Behavior:**

- Stores the file in R2 and updates `cv_file_url`.
- Extracts text into `cv_text` (this flips `cv_readable` to `true`).
- Regenerates `ai_summary`.
- If the candidate has an assigned job and `is_score_overridden` is `false`: re-scores that job and updates `ai_score`. If no job is assigned, the summary is regenerated but no score is written. If overridden, `ai_score` is left untouched.

**Response:** `200 OK` (returns the full candidate object).

**Errors:**

- `400 Bad Request` — missing `cv_file`, file over 10 MB, or invalid file type.
- `404 Not Found` — candidate not found.

### `POST /candidates/:id/score/revert`

Clear a manual score override and return to an AI score.

**Behavior:**

- Sets `is_score_overridden = false`.
- If the candidate has an assigned job and CV text: re-scores immediately and updates `ai_score`.
- If no job is assigned or no CV text exists: sets `ai_score = null`.

**Response:** `200 OK` (returns the full candidate object).

**Errors:**

- `404 Not Found` — candidate not found.

### `POST /candidates/:id/reject`

Reject a candidate — sets `candidate.status = 'rejected'` and updates their Application stage to 'rejected'. Idempotent: safe to call multiple times.

**Request Body:** Empty object

```json
{}
```

**Response:** `200 OK` (returns full CandidateResponse with `is_rejected: true`)

**Errors:**

- `404 Not Found` — candidate not found

### `POST /candidates/:id/stages/:stage_id/advance`

Composite action: saves the summary for the current stage AND advances the candidate to the next enabled hiring stage. Stages are ordered by `order` asc; the next stage after `current_stage_id` is selected.

**Path Parameters:**

- `id`: Candidate UUID
- `stage_id`: Current hiring stage UUID

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "summary": "Ready to move to interview round."
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

## 6. Health API

### `GET /health`

System health check for monitoring.

**Response:** `200 OK` or `503 Service Unavailable`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "redis": "ok"
  },
  "uptime": 3600
}
```

**Degraded Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "checks": {
    "database": "fail",
    "redis": "ok"
  },
  "uptime": 3600
}
```

---

## 7. Auth API

All auth endpoints share the base URL `http://localhost:3000/api`.
Session is maintained via an **HTTP-only cookie** (`talent_os_session`) set by the backend.
_(Note for Backend: You must configure CORS with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and specify the exact frontend origin, otherwise the browser will reject the cookie)._

---

### `GET /auth/me`

Return the currently authenticated user's session.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "email": "sarah@company.com",
  "role": "owner",
  "org_id": "uuid",
  "org_name": "Triolla",
  "org_logo_url": "https://cdn.example.com/logos/uuid.png",
  "auth_provider": "google",
  "has_completed_onboarding": true
}
```

**Errors:**

- `401 Unauthorized` — no active session

---

### `POST /auth/google/verify`

Verify a Google OAuth `access_token` obtained from the SPA (via `useGoogleLogin` implicit flow). Backend must use this token to fetch the user's profile from the Google UserInfo endpoint (`https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`), validate the email, and then create/update the session.

**Request Body:**

```json
{ "access_token": "<Google Access Token>" }
```

**Behavior:**

- Backend fetches user info (email, name, picture) using the provided token.
- On new user (sign-up path): creates Tenant + User with `role = 'owner'`
- On returning user: updates session
- If email already exists with a different provider: returns `409 Conflict` with `code: "EMAIL_EXISTS"`

**Response:** `200 OK` — same shape as `GET /auth/me`

**Errors:**

- `400 Bad Request` — missing or malformed `credential`
- `401 Unauthorized` — Google token verification failed
- `409 Conflict` — email exists with a different auth provider (`code: "EMAIL_EXISTS"`)

**Notes:**

- The frontend does NOT redirect. It receives the session and the `RequireGuest` route guard handles in-app navigation.
- The backend sets the `talent_os_session` HttpOnly cookie in the response. All subsequent requests include this cookie automatically because the Axios instance is configured with `withCredentials: true`.

---

### `POST /auth/logout`

Destroy the current session cookie.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

---

### `POST /auth/onboarding`

Complete onboarding for a newly signed-up owner. Sets org name and optional logo.

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

**Form Fields:**

- `org_name` (required): string
- `logo` (optional): image file — PNG, JPG, or SVG, max 2 MB

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

**Errors:**

- `400 Bad Request` — `org_name` missing or invalid
- `401 Unauthorized` — no session
- `409 Conflict` — onboarding already completed

---

### `GET /auth/invite/:token`

Validate an invitation token and return its details. Called before the user clicks "Join".

**Path Parameters:**

- `token`: The one-time invitation token from the magic link

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "org_name": "Triolla",
  "role": "member",
  "email": "invitee@company.com"
}
```

**Errors:**

- `404 Not Found` — token does not exist (`NOT_FOUND`)
- `409 Conflict` — token already used (`INVITE_USED`)
- `410 Gone` — token expired (`INVITE_EXPIRED`)

---

### `POST /auth/invite/:token/accept`

Accept an invitation. Creates the user in the DB, marks invitation as accepted, and sets a session cookie.

**Path Parameters:**

- `token`: The one-time invitation token

**Response:** `200 OK` — same shape as `GET /auth/me`

**Errors:**

- `404 Not Found` — token does not exist
- `409 Conflict` — already used
- `410 Gone` — expired

---

### `POST /auth/magic-link`

**Request Body:**

```json
{ "email": "user@company.com" }
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{ "success": true }
```

**Notes:**

- Always returns 200 (does not reveal whether email exists, for security)
- If the email belongs to a Google-auth user, the backend sends an email telling them to use Google login instead

---

### `GET /auth/magic-link/verify`

Verify a magic-link login token (the link emailed to the user for returning logins).

**Query Parameters:**

- `token`: magic link token

**Behavior:** Sets session cookie, redirects to `/`

## Multi-Tenancy

All endpoints operate within a tenant context:

- Tenant ID is determined by the `x-tenant-id` header or environment config
- All data is automatically filtered by tenant
- No cross-tenant data leakage is possible

## PM Bridge

All routes are under `/api/pm-bridge`. `/converse`, `/commit`, and `/decisions` require a
session cookie and PM-Bridge allowlist membership. `/holds/:id/{approve,reject}` are public,
gated by a signed token from the notification email. The PM-facing payloads never contain
Jira concepts (issue type, key, epic, acceptance criteria).

### POST /pm-bridge/converse
Request: `{ "messages": [{ "role": "pm"|"assistant", "content": string }], "page": { "name": string, "route": string } }`
Response (one of):
- `{ "type": "clarify", "questions": [{ "id": string, "prompt": string, "chips": string[], "allowFreeText": boolean }] }`
- `{ "type": "ready", "goal": string, "brief": InternalBrief }`  ← echo `brief` back to /commit unchanged
- `{ "type": "held" }`

### POST /pm-bridge/commit
Request: `{ "brief": InternalBrief, "page": { "name": string, "route": string } }`
Response: `{ "type": "filed" | "merged" | "held" }`

`InternalBrief = { goal, problem, desiredOutcomes: string[], constraints: string[],
affectedArea: { name, route }, sizeHint: "tiny"|"medium"|"large", devNotes: string[],
rawText, conversationDigest }` — opaque to the client; pass through verbatim.

### GET|POST /pm-bridge/holds/:id/approve  · GET|POST /pm-bridge/holds/:id/reject
Public. Query `?t=<signed token>`. GET returns an HTML confirm page; POST performs the action
and returns an HTML result page.

### GET/POST /pm-bridge/decisions · PATCH /pm-bridge/decisions/:id
Unchanged from the existing decisions contract.
